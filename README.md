# QT-Icon-Theme-Availability
Displays all of the available icons natively available. Useful for non-Freedesktop.org compliant systems.

This can be useful when wanting to use native icons in toolbars or buttons, as many common icons may not be available and will have to have an alternate supplied.

It generates a visible list of each icon and their name based on the Freedesktop.org specifications. Any thing that is not available will not be listed.

Makes use of QT6, and CMake.
