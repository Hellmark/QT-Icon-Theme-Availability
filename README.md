# QT-Icon-Theme-Availability
Displays all of the available icons natively available. Useful for non-Freedesktop.org compliant systems.

This can be useful when wanting to use native icons in toolbars or buttons, as many common icons may not be available and will have to have an alternate supplied.

Makes use of QT6, and CMake.
